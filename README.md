## Overview

This repository analyzes the **Music & Mental Health Survey Results** dataset provided by [Catherine Rasgaitis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results). Music is deeply intertwined with peopleâ€™s lives and emotions. Understanding how music preferences and habits affect mental health is crucial for mental health practitioners, the music industry, and individuals striving to improve their well-being. This analysis explores the relationship between music preferences, streaming habits, and self-reported mental health conditions among survey respondents. By uncovering trends and associations, the study aims to provide valuable insights for promoting mental wellness through music.
